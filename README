How it works:

- Each user has a master key on Cloud KMS.  This is an encryption/decryption
  device which ensures that nobody gets to see the encryption key.

- Each secret file is stored on Google Storage in the trust-networks-credentials
  bucket.  There is a top level directory for each user, and the files are
  container therein.

- There are two levels of encryption: Each secret file is encrypted with its
  own key, AES256, 256-bit key.  That key is itself encrypted with the master
  key and then stored in the <filename>.key.

To use credential creation:

- You need a service account actor on Google cloud. User needs Cloud KMS
  Admin role and Storage admin, and create a JSON key file, place it in
  the current directory call it private.json.

- If a user has no KMS key setup, you should run:

    ./setup-ckms private.json email@domain.com

  If you're not sure, it's safe to run this.

- To create a VPN key:

    ./create-vpn-key email@domain.com device-id

  e.g.

    ./create-vpn-key mark.adams@trustnetworks.com mark-mac

- To create a web key:

    ./create-web-key email@domain.com "Certificate Name"

  e.g.

    ./create-web-key mark.adams@trustnetworks.com "Mark Adams (Trust Networks)"

  When users have multiple certificates in their keychain, e.g. to different
  TN clusters, it can be useful to have the cluster name in the certificate
  to make it easier to choose.
